## Consigne

In this project, you create a web application that should contain at least one HTML page. While, to my knowledge, The main difference between a web page and a web application is in terms of content and interaction. Web pages mostly presents some content and may have a dose of user interactivity while web applications can be thought of as software on the web sharing characteristics with desktop application. In this project, some examples to emulate these characteristics may be a product stock management system or games like chess, puzzle, etc. This project is mostly based on the use of JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements. It will be examined based on the PROPER use of the following aspects:

    <!-- String object -->
    <!-- Functions -->
    <!-- Conditional Statements -->
    Loops: should include the use of at least While, for ... in and for .. of loop
    <!-- Arrays -->
    JavaScript Validation (genre validation d'input pour v√©rifier)
    <!-- Prototypes & User-defined objects -->
    DOM, more specifically manipulation of HTML elements using JavaScript. Manipulation should include:
        addition of HTML elements
        remove of HTML elements
        <!-- Update of HTML elements (changing the content or changing the style) -->
    The web application should be hosted online. There are several online services that propose free hosting.
